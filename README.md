# LLM-Translator

LLM-Translator is a comprehensive tool designed to transcribe audio files utilizing OpenAI's Whisper API and subsequently manipulate the generated transcript through OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. Additionally, the project offers the capability to translate the transcript into various languages utilizing GPT-3.5.

## Installation and Setup 

### Prerequisites

Before utilizing this tool, ensure that you have an OpenAI account and an OpenAI [API key](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) and to follow the installation procedure.

  - Execute the installer wizard, `python-3.11.5-amd64.exe` for example.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è  Beware to tick the `Add python.exe to PATH` option on the first installation page before cliking the `Install Now` button.
    - Follow the installation procedure and choose default settings.

2. __Download [GitBash](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.42.0.windows.2/Git-2.42.0.2-64-bit.exe) on official website__
  - Execute the wizard installer, `git-2.42.0.2-64-bit.exe` for example.
  - Follow the installation procedure and choose default settings.
3. Open Git Bash 

4. **Clone the Repository**  
   - `git clone https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator.git`

5. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   - `cd LLM-Translator/`

6. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:  
   - Create a `.env` file.
    - `nano .env` 
   - Add the following line, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key (go [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) for futher details).
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"`
    - Press `Ctrl+X` and then `y` and `Enter` to quit nano and save file. 

4. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**:  
   - `python -m venv env`

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:  
   - `source env/Scripts/activate`

6. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## LLM-Translator Usage

Please follow these steps *each time* you want to run LLM-Translator:

0. **Open a terminal (or Gitbash for windows users)**
  - Go to LLM-Translator directory
   - `cd LLM-Translator`
  - Update the repository
   - `git pull` 

1. **activate the Python Environment**  
   - `source env/bin/activate` 
   - or `source env/Scripts/activate` for windows users

2. **Prepare Input Files**:  
   - Before running the program, you have to create subfolders inside the `/inputs/` directory and populate them with `.txt` and `.md` files that you wish to translate.
   - All the files in a subfolder should be written in the same language. 

3. **Execute the Program**:  
   - `python3 main.py` for linux users
   - `python main.py` for windows users

4. **Follow the On-screen Instructions** 
   

**Note**: Translations will be automatically stored in an associated subfolder into the `/outputs/` folder. 
**Note 2:** A better installation process will be done soon‚Ñ¢ with executable files for windows and linux.
