# LLM-Translator 

This project provides functionality for transcribing audio files using OpenAI's Whisper API and manipulating the resulting transcript using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. The project can also translate the transcript into different languages using GPT-3.5.

## Requirements

Before using the project, you must have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The OpenAI Python library (`openai`) - you can install this library using pip: `pip install openai`
- An OpenAI API key - you can obtain an API key from the OpenAI website: https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project code to your local machine.
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable with the name `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Install the `openai` library using pip: `pip install openai`.
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
5. Run the `view.py` file using Python: `python view.py`.
6. Follow the prompts to choose an audio file, transcribe the audio, save the transcript to a file, and translate the transcript to a chosen language.

Note: The audio files should be located in the `audio` folder of the project directory. The transcripts and translations will be saved to the `outputs` folder.
