# LLM-Translator

LLM-Translator is a comprehensive tool designed to transcribe audio files utilizing OpenAI's Whisper API and subsequently manipulate the generated transcript through OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. Additionally, the project offers the capability to translate the transcript into various languages utilizing GPT-3.5.

## Prerequisites

Before utilizing this tool, ensure the installation of:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI Python library (`openai`)
- An OpenAI [API key](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

## Installation and Setup

LLM-Translator has been successfully tested on Ubuntu 20.04, with planned compatibility for MacOS and Windows.

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - `git clone https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator.git`

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   - `cd LLM-Translator/`

3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:  
   - Create a `.env` file.
    - `nano .env` 
   - Add the following line, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key.
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"`

4. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**:  
   - `python3 -m venv env`

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:  
   - `source env/bin/activate`

6. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. **If not already activated, activate the Python Environment**:  
   - `source env/bin/activate`

2. **Prepare Input Files**:  
   - Create subfolders inside the `/inputs/` directory and populate them with `.txt` and `.md` files you wish to translate. 

3. **Execute the Program**:  
   - `python3 main.py`

4. **Follow the On-screen Instructions** 
   

**Note**: Translations will be automatically stored in an associated subfolder into the `/outputs/` folder.
